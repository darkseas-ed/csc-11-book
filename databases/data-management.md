# Data Management

We will look at how and why we organise information, and how databases can
assist us to do this.

We will look at how databases are constructed from tables of data,
which are, in turn, constructed from attributes and records.

We will use SQL to construct, query and modify tables and entire databases.

Lastly, we will look at our ethical legal and security responsibilities at
developers of data management solutions.
