# Database Management Systems

Database management systems are the software tools that we use to manage
databases. They can help visualise the structure of the database, view and edit
data, and build queries and reports.

Some software tools are specific to the database, for example:
* pgAdmin is used for Postgres
* MySQL Workbench for MySQL

Because of the common standard of Structured Query Language (SQL) there are
 tools can be used across different database implementations.

## Data vs Information

The distinction between data and information informs why we use databases
instead of unstructured data-lakes.

## Flatfile vs Relational Databases

Flat file databases are familiar to us as tables of data in spreadsheets or data
summaries. Relational databases seek to bring guarantees of data integrity to
these collections of information.

## RDBMS

Relational database management systems assist and autoomate the maintenance and
interrogation of these structured data sources.
