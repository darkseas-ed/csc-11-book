# Data and information

**Data** refers to the text, numbers, dates or logical values that describe the
characteristics of the people, objects and processes of our world.
We consider **data** to be the low-level representation of values as bits and
bytes.

Examples of data are:
* "Jonathon"
* 3.0e8
* 190

**Information** implies labelling of data to give meaning, links to other data
to describe relationships and an organisation of links to provide structure and meaning.

Examples of information are:
* "Jonathon" the oldest living animal,
* 3.0e8 ms{sup}`-1`, the approximate speed of light (not the speed of Jonathon)
* 190 years, the age Jonathon was in 2022 (which would make him 191 years old by
  now)

The distinction between data and information is important because without the
context or label for a piece of data, it can be difficult to use or apply to
other solutions or areas.
