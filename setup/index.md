# Setup and installation

To study programming this semester we will need three tools.

1. Access to a common class resource, 
2. A python installation and related set of packages
3. A code editor to write and run Python code

I hope you have all received an invitation to the Computer Science 11 ATAR 2023 OneNote.
Go and check you email for that now, and follow the link to open the OneNote.

## A Python installation - Anaconda Python
The programming language Python works across all major operating systems,
however, beneath the surface, we rely on packages of code that work differently
on Windows, Mac and Linux. To ensure that we can display images, read files and
plot graphs equally, we need to ensure we have the right packages beneath the
surface. Anaconda Python help us do this, no matter which operating system you
use.

## A code editor - Visual Studio Code
A code editor is an application that lets you manipualte text directly, with no
hidden formatting or characters.
